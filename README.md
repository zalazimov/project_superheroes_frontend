# About:

<p>
This project has been a challenging, yet exciting endeavor to create an app of a genre I happen to be passionate about: Superheroes. To keep things running smoothly, I utilized a Trello board to track my progress as well as through regular GitHub commits.

I hope you enjoy my new app, BAM!POW!, a React application designed to utilize superhero database for in-depth superhero and villain searches!

## Instructions

<ol>
<li>
When you get to the landing page, you will be presented with a brief intro of the app. You can either click on the 'here' link in the description or click on the 'BAM!POW!' logo at the top left of your screen to be brought to a featured heroes page that has a list of randomly generated heroes you can choose from. You can also access the featured heroes page at any point by clicking on the 'BAM!POW!' logo, regardless of what page you are currently on. Clicking on any hero on the featured hero page will send you to the show page for that hero
</li>
<li>
 Navigate to the search bar: On the BAM!POW! homepage, you will find a search bar located at the top of the page.
</li>
<li>Enter your search query: Type the name or even part of the name of the superhero that you are looking to find into the search bar. For example, you can search for "Batman"</li>
<li>Click on the search button: Next to the search bar, there is a search button. Click on it or press Enter on your keyboard to initiate the search.</li>
<li>Browse the search results: BAM!POW! will display a list of heroes related to your search query. Each hero item will have a thumbnail and name of that superhero.</li>
<li>Click on superhero/villain: When you find a character that interests you, just click on its thumbnail or title. This will take you to that character's dedicated page.</li>
<li>Show page: On the hero show page, you will find more information about that hero, including a character history, description of their powers, combat and power scores, as well as their first appearances. You will also have the option of editing information about that hero or simply deleting that hero</li>
<li>Clicking on the trash icon will give you a prompt to delete that hero from the database</li>
<li>Clicking on the edit icon (the pen and notepad icon) will provide you with a form to edit information for that hero, that will then update the database</li>
<li>At the top of the screen, you can find an 'Add Hero' option that, when clicked, will bring you to a form page to add information for a new hero</li>
<li>Creating a hero: After clicking on 'Add Hero' and filling out the relevant information in the form, clicking 'Submit' will now add your new hero to the database</li>
<li>Note: Any new hero that is added will be given an id number that is +1 of the highest current id number available in the database. To see your new hero in the database, you can click on the 'Index' link at the top of your page and when being brought to the Database Index page, make sure to invert the list by id by clicking on the 'Sort' button at the top-left of the chart. This will show you the highest id number in the database, which will now include your newest hero entry</li>
